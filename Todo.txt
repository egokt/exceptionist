- Add standard actions: ignore, ?
- Allow addition of custom defined actions, to be used across all the classes
  in the program. I.e. one can define an action "mylogger", and have
exceptionist declarations to just refer to that action
- Add ability to catch a given exception (or all exceptions) in all classes (or
  everywhere)
